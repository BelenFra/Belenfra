### Hi there 👋

<!--
**BelenFra/Belenfra** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

 I´m industrial engineering. Currently, I am part of the Operations Strategy team at Pickit, working as a Logistic Networks Data Analyst. 

📈I'm passionate about the data, which is why I studied Data Analytics at Coderhouse and later pursued Data Science. There, I was able to utilize tools such as Power BI and the Python language to complete my Machine Learning project.
